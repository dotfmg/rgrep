# rgrep

Mini `grep` in Rust, built step by step.

## Goal

Search text in files or STDIN with a set of basic but useful features.

## Roadmap (summary)

- MVP: substring, `-i`, `-n`, STDIN, prefixes for multiple files, exit codes (0/1/2).
- Future: `-v`, `-c`, regex, recursive, color, context, performance.
